Hi there, I'm Christian... 👋

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123087687/221354891-28eb9411-16df-453f-8c34-a80b7b90ba49.jpeg" width="271" height="310">

I'm training to be a software engineer with the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk); a collaborative coding bootcamp aimed at fullstack development.

I am making the leap into tech after eight years as a primary school teacher, teaching all classes and abilities in the UK and abroad. I am passionate about using code to benefit others -— you can follow my journey here or you can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianwillcox/).

If you don't find me at my computer, you'll probably find me playing with my cats or exploring the great outdoors 🏕️.

I'm currently learning:

🌱 Javascript
🌱 CSS
🌱 HTML


🤟
